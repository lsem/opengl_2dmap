To have data accessible by the code, unpack archives in a way that unpacked zip archive has folder of the same name without .zip extension.
E.g. if you have `ne_10m_land.zip` after unpacking there should be folder ne_10m_land.

Gitignore uses '/*' rule to ignore all directories in data/ folder.

Then add environment variable DATA_ROOT to point to data/ directory.
